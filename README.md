# Restful API with Mongo DB
RESTful API with Python and Flask, and MongoDB

Hello!

I followed this Miquel Grinberg's awesome Flask tutorial, and decided to extend it with NoSQL database (Mongo DB) and to create comprehensive unit tests for the whole thing. 

Miquel's great tutorial can be found from here: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/designing-a-restful-api-with-python-and-flask
